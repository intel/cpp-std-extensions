== `intrusive_list.hpp`

`intrusive_list` is a doubly-linked list designed for use at compile-time or
with static objects. It supports pushing and popping at the front or back,
forward iteration, and insertion and removal from the middle.

[source,cpp]
----
// A node in an intrusive_list must have prev and next pointers
struct node {
  node *prev{};
  node *next{};
};

stdx::intrusive_list<node> l;

node n1{};
l.push_front(&n1);

node n2{};
l.push_back(&n2);

node n3{};
auto i = std::find_if(std::begin(l), std::end(l), /* some predicate */);
l.insert(i, &n3); // insertion into the middle is constant-time

l.remove(&n2); // removal from the middle is constant-time
node* nf = l.pop_front();
node* nb = l.pop_back();

l.clear();
bool b = l.empty();
----

NOTE: An `intrusive_list` requires its node type to have `prev` and `next`
pointers of the appropriate type, and this is enforced by concept constraints
after C++20. However, an `intrusive_list` can also be instantiated with an
incomplete type. Of course the type must be complete at the point of using the
list.

=== Node validity checking

An `intrusive_list` has a second template parameter which is whether to operate
with or without node validity checking. The default is
`stdx::node_policy::checked`.

[source,cpp]
----
// The second template argument here is the default
stdx::intrusive_list<node, stdx::node_policy::checked> l;
----

This means that:

- nodes to be inserted/pushed must have `prev` and `next` pointers equal to `nullptr`
- node `prev` and `next` pointers are cleared on removal/pop

NOTE: The second item here means that `clear` is a linear-time operation with
`stdx::node_policy::checked`. For faster but less safe operation,
`stdx::node_policy::unchecked` is available.

If the validity policy is violated (for example by attempting to push a node
whose pointers are already populated) the result is a xref:panic.adoc#_panic_hpp[panic].
