== `optional.hpp`

https://github.com/intel/cpp-std-extensions/blob/main/include/stdx/optional.hpp[`optional.hpp`]
provides an implementation that mirrors
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/optional[`<optional>`], but uses
`tombstone_traits` instead of a `bool` variable.

Here is a problem with `std::optional`:

[source,cpp]
----
enum struct S1 : std::uint8_t { /* ... values ... */ };
static_assert(sizeof(S1) == 1);
static_assert(sizeof(std::optional<S1> == 2);

enum struct S2 : std::uint16_t { /* ... values ... */ };
static_assert(sizeof(S2) == 2);
static_assert(sizeof(std::optional<S2>) == 4);

enum struct S3 : std::uint32_t { /* ... values ... */ };
static_assert(sizeof(S3) == 4);
static_assert(sizeof(std::optional<S3>) == 8);
----

`std::optional` basically stores a `bool` flag as well as the type. Because of
size and alignment constraints, `std::optional` of a small type typically ends
up being double the size of the type. Much of the time, we aren't using all the
bits in the type - especially if it's an enumeration - so there is probably some
sentinel value that we can treat as "invalid". AKA a "tombstone".

This is where `tombstone_traits` come in: specializing `stdx::tombstone_traits`
allows us to specify that sentinel value and avoid storing an extra `bool`.

NOTE: The name "tombstone" arises from use in hash maps where it is used to signal
a "dead" object.

[source,cpp]
----
enum struct S : std::uint8_t { /* ... values ... */ };

template <> struct stdx::tombstone_traits<S> {
    // "-1" is not a valid value
    constexpr auto operator()() const {
        return static_cast<S>(std::uint8_t{0xffu});
    }
};

static_assert(sizeof(S) == 1);
static_assert(sizeof(stdx::optional<S> == 1);
----

To use `stdx::optional`, specialize `stdx::tombstone_traits` for the required
type, giving it a call operator that returns the sentinel value. After that,
`stdx::optional`'s interface mirrors that of
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional[`std::optional`]. The C\+â€‹+23
monadic operations on `std::optional` are available on `stdx::optional` with
C++17.

Why a call operator and not just a `static` value? To deal with move-only (and
even non-movable) types.

NOTE: Like `std::optional`, `stdx::optional` can be constructed with
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/nullopt_t[`std::nullopt`] or
with https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/in_place[`std::in_place`].
(`stdx` does not redefine these types.)

NOTE: `stdx::optional` does not use exceptions. There is no
`stdx::bad_optional_access`. If you access a disengaged `stdx::optional`, you
will get the tombstone value!

=== Tombstone values

Instead of specializing `stdx::tombstone_traits`, sometimes it's easier
(especially for integral or enumeration types) to provide the tombstone value
inline. We can do this with `stdx::tombstone_value`.

[source,cpp]
----
auto o = stdx::optional<int, stdx::tombstone_value<-1>>{};
----

CAUTION: Don't specialize `tombstone_traits` for the builtin integral types -
that's risky if the definition is seen more widely. Instead use a
`stdx::tombstone_value` where needed.

NOTE: The default `tombstone_traits` for floating-point types have
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/infinity[infinity] as the
tombstone value. At first thought,
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/isnan[NaN] is the obvious
tombstone, but NaNs never compare equal to anything, not even themselves.

For tuple-like types, if all of their component parts provide tombstone values,
a tombstone value for them is synthesized:

[source,cpp]
----
// S has a tombstone value, therefore so does std::tuple<S, S>
auto o = stdx::optional{std::tuple{S{42}, S{17}}};
----

=== Multi-argument `transform`

`stdx::optional` provides one extra feature over `std::optional`: the ability to
call `transform` with multiple arguments.
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/transform[C++23 `transform`]
is a member function on `stdx::optional` too, but `stdx::transform` exists also
as a free function on `stdx::optional`.

[source,cpp]
----
// S is a struct with tombstone_traits that contains an integer value

auto opt1 = stdx::optional<S>{17};
auto opt2 = stdx::optional<S>{42};
auto opt_sum = transform(
    [](S const &x, S const &y) { return S{x.value + y.value}; },
    opt1, opt2);
----

This flavor of `transform` returns the result of the function only if all of its
`stdx::optional` arguments are engaged. If any one is not, a disengaged
`stdx::optional` is returned.

=== Unpacking `transform` and `and_then`

When the contained `value_type` supports the tuple protocol with `apply`,
`transform` (or `and_then`) can unpack it to pass arguments to a function:

[source,cpp]
----
auto opt1 = stdx::optional{std::tuple{S{42}, S{17}}};
auto opt_sum = transform(
    [](S const &x, S const &y) { return S{x.value + y.value}; },
    opt1);
// result is stdx::optional{S{59}}
----
