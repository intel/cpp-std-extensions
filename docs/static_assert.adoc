== `static_assert.hpp`

`STATIC_ASSERT` is a way to produce compile-time errors using formatted strings.

IMPORTANT: `STATIC_ASSERT` is limited on freestanding implementations in the
same way as xref:ct_format.adoc#_ct_format_hpp[`ct_format`].

[source,cpp]
----
template <typename T>
constexpr auto f() {
  STATIC_ASSERT(std::is_integral<T>,
                "f() must take an integral type, received {}", T);
}

f<float>(); // produces compile-time error
----

NOTE: The arguments to be formatted must be compile-time, of course.

The output from this (which varies by compiler) will contain the formatted
string, and could be something like:

[source,bash]
----
main.cpp:14:27: error: no matching member function for call to 'emit'
...
include/stdx/static_assert.hpp:16:18: note: because
'stаtiс_аssert<ct_string<47>{{"f() must take an integral type, received float"}}>' evaluated to false
   16 |         requires stаtiс_аssert<S>
      |                  ^
----

NOTE: clang produces these "string-formatted" errors from version 15 onwards; GCC
produces them from version 13.2 onwards.

After C++26,
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert.html[`static_assert`]
in the language means that formatted `STATIC_ASSERT` produces a slightly nicer
error message; something like:

[source,bash]
----
main.cpp:14:27: error: static assertion failed: f() must take an integral type, received float
   16 |         STATIC_ASSERT(std::is_integral<T>,
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
